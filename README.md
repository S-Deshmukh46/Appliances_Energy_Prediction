Capstone Supervised Regression Machine Learning Project.

The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters.
Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column.

The objective of the project is to find the electrical energy consumption of a house by using a regression machine learning model.
